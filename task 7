 for the Basic Data Explorationwe shown that the dataset contains [148654] rows and [13] columns, Data types of each column vary and It varies between float ,string and integer. As a descriptive statistics The BasePay shows a mean of [66325.448840], mode of [0.0], minimum of [ 166.010000], and maximum of [319275.010000].The range of BasePay is [319441.02], indicating a wide spread.The standard deviation of BasePay is [42764.63549525887], suggesting variability around the mean.The correlation between Base Pay and Total Pay was calculated using the .corr() method in Pandas.A scatter plot was generated using Matplotlib to visualize the relationship between the two variables.The correlation coefficient Investigating relationships between Base Pay and Total Pay was found to be [0.95]. Missing values in the dataset were handled by [Remove Missing Values (Drop Rows or Columns)]. This approach was selected because [This method removes entire rows or columns containing missing values. It's suitable when the missing data is limited and doesn't significantly impact the analysis. ].finally as a conclusion the analysis serves as a foundation for more in-depth exploration and modeling.
